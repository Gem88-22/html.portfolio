 <h3>The Choice</h3>

 <p>The best Love story of my life.<br />
Waiting for the love of your life with a decision that can't take it back. </p>

 <h3>Fifty Shades</h3>

 <p>It was a very spicy movie for me.<br />
The patience to understand each other and how they respect one another.</p>

<h3>Burlesque</h3>

<p>The confidence  to take one step forward and <br />
 face the fear and get your goal.<br />
It was a satisfying movie for me. </p>
